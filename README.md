# WiresharkTrafficAnalysis
Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark.

## Objective
Capture live network packets using Wireshark and analyze basic internet protocols like DNS, TCP, HTTP, ICMP, and TLS.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark

## Protocols Observed
- DNS – Domain name resolution
- TCP – Reliable transport
- HTTP – Plain text web traffic
- ICMP – Ping/diagnostic messages
- TLS – Encrypted web communication

## Summary
Traffic was generated by browsing websites and using ping commands. Packets were filtered and studied to understand protocol behaviors.
